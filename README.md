A minimal new tab page for Chrome

This is essentially a clone of Momentum Dash., which can be found here: https://momentumdash.com/

I made this to add extra personalization and extra features.

Currently, the weather is obtained by calling my domain (api.k0shy.com) and from there calling Open Weather Map to retrieve the weather data. This is so I can cache weather conditions on my server so I don't need to do excessive API calls to Open Weather Map.

Weather is cached for 1 hour. Absolutely no identifiable data is captured when calling my API.
